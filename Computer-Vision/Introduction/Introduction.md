# Introduction

Why is vision so difficult? In part, it is because vision is an **inverse** problem, in which we seek to recover some unknowns given insufficient information to fully specify the solution. We must therefore resort to physics-based and probabilistic models to disambiguate between potential solutions. However, modeling the visual world in all of its rich complexity is far more difficult than, say, modeling the vocal tract that produces spoken sounds.

## Applications of Computer Visions

+ **Optical character recognition(OCR):** reading handwritten postal codes on letters and automatic number plate recognition.
+ **Machine inspection:** rapid parts inspection for quality assurance using stereo vision with specialized illumination to measure tolerances on aircraft wings or auto body parts or looking for defects in steel castings using X-ray vision.
+ **Retail:** object recognition for automated checkout lanes.
+ **3D model building(photogrammetry):** fully automated construction of 3D models from aerial photographs used in system such as Bing Maps.
+ **Medical imaging:** registering pre-operative and intra-operative imagery or performing long-term studdies of people's brain morphology as they age.
+ **Automotive safety:** detecting unexpected obstacles such as pedestrians on the street, under conditions where active vision techniques such as radar or lidar do not work well.
+ **Match move:** merging computer-generated imagery(CGI) with live action footage by tracking feature points in the source video to estimate the 3D camera motion and shape of the environment.
+ **Motion capture(mocap):** using retro-reflective markers viewed from multiple cameras or other vision-based techniques to capture actors for computer animation.
+ **Surveillance:** monitoring for intruders, analyzing highway traffic, and monitoring pools for drowing victims.
+ **Fingerprint recognition and biometrics:** for automatic access authentication as well as forensic application.

## Photographs and Videos

+ **Stitching:** turning overlapping photos into a single seamlessly stitched panorama.
+ **Exposure bracketing:** merging multiple exposures taken under challenging lighting conditions (strong sunlight and shadows) into a single perfectly exposed image.
+ **Video match move and stabilization:** inserting 2D picture or 3D models into your videos by automatically tracking nearby reference points or using motion estimates to remove shake from your videos.
+ **Photo-based walkthroughs:** navigating a large collection of photographs, such as the interior of your house, by flying between different photos in 3D.
+ **Face detection:** for improved camera focusing as well as more relevant image searching.
+ **Visual authentication:** automatically logging family members onto your home computer as they sit down in front of the webcam.
