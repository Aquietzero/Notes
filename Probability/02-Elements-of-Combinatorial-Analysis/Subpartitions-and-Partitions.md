# Subpopulations and Partitions

## Theorem 2

Let r1, ..., rk be integers such that

    r1 + r2 + ... + rk = n

The number of ways in which a population of n elements can be divided into k ordered parts (partitioned into k subpopulations) of which the first contains r1 elements, the second r2 elements, etc., is

    n! / (r1!r2!...rk!)

The above number is call **multinomial coefficient**.
