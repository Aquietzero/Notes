# Basic Definitions and Rules

## Fundamental Convention

Given a discrete sample space S with sample points E1, E2, ..., we shall assume that with each point Ej there is associated a number, called the probability of Ej and denoted by P{Ej}. It is to be non-negative and such that

    P{E1} + P{E2} + ... = 1

## Definition

The probability P{A} of any event A is the sum of the probabilities of all sample points in it.

## Theorem

For any two events A1 and A2 the probability that either A1 or A2 or both occur is given by

    P{A1∪ A2} = P{A1} + P{A2} - P{A1A2}

If A1A2 = 0, that is, if A1 and A2 are mutually exclusive, then the above equation reduces to

    P{A1∪ A2} = P{A1} + P{A2}
