# Solutions for Chapter [The Sample Space]

## Problem 1.

Actually, for this problem ,we can list all the basic events of the experiment.

    E1  = {1, 2}, E2  = {1, 3}, E3  = {1, 4}, E4  = {1, 5}
    E5  = {2, 1}, E6  = {2, 3}, E7  = {2, 4}, E8  = {2, 5}
    E9  = {3, 1}, E10 = {3, 2}, E11 = {3, 4}, E12 = {3, 5}
    E13 = {4, 1}, E14 = {4, 2}, E15 = {4, 3}, E16 = {4, 5}
    E17 = {5, 1}, E18 = {5, 2}, E19 = {5, 3}, E20 = {5, 4}

(a) The event can be expressed as Ea = { E1, E2, E3, E4, E9, E10, E11, E12, E17, E18, E19, E20 }, P{Ea} = 12/20 = 3/5.
(b) The event can be expressed as Eb = { E2, E4, E5, E6, E8, E9, E12, E13, E15, E16, E17, E19}, P{Eb} = 12/20 = 3/5.
(c) The event can be expressed as Ec = { E2, E4, E9, E12, E17, E19 }, P{Ec} = 6/20 = 3/10.
