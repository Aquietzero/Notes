# Discrete Sample Space

## Definition

A sample space is called discrete if it contains only finitely many points or infinitely many points which can be arranged into a simple sequence E1, E2, ...

We are here confronted with a distinction familiar in mechanics. There it is usual first to consider discrete mass points with each individual point carrying a finite mass, and then to pass to the notion of a continuous mass distribution, where each individual point has zero mass. In the first case, the mass of a system is obtained simply by adding the masses of the individual points; in the second case, masses are computed by integration over mass densities. Quite similarly, the probabilities of events in discrete sample spaces are botained by mere additions, whereas in other spaces integrations are necessary. **Except for the technical tools required, there is no essential difference between the two cases.**
