# Relations Among Events

## Definition 1

We shall use the notation A = 0 to express that the event A contains no sample points (is impossible). The zero must be interpreted in a symbolic ssense and not as the numeral.

## Definition 2

The event consisting of all points not contained in the event A will be called the complementary event (or negation) of A and will be denoted by A'. In particular, S' = 0.

With any two events A and B we can associate two new events defined by the conditions "both A and B occur" and "either A or B or both occur." These events will be denoted by AB and A∪ B, respectively. The event AB contains all sample points which are common to A and B. If A and B exclude each other, then there are no points common to A and B and the event AB is impossible. This situation is describe by the equation

    AB = 0

which should be read "A and B are mutually exclusive".

## Definition 3

To every collection A, B, C, ...j of events we define two new events as follows. The aggregate of the sample points which belong to all the given sets will be denoted by ABC... and called the **intersection** (or simultaneous realization&lt;同时实现&gt;) of A, B, C, ... The aggregate of sample points which belong to at least one of the given sets will be denoted by A∪ B∪ C... and called the **union** (or realization of at least one&lt;至少有一个实现&gt;) of the given events. The events A, B, C, ... are mutually exclusive if no two have a point in common, that is, if AB = 0, AC = 0, ... , BC = 0, ...

## Definition 4

The symbols A⊂ B and B⊃ A are equivalent and signify that every point of A is contained in B; they are read, respectively, "A implies B" and "B is implied by A". If this is the case, we shall also write "B - A instead of BA" to denote the event that B but not A occurs.
