# Solutions

## Problem 1.

Suppose:

+ A = { No two dice show the same face. }
+ B = { At least one ace shows up. }

Hence:

    P{B|A} = P{AB} / P{A} = 1 - [(5*4*3)/(6*5*4)] = 1/2

## Probldm 2.

Suppose:

+ A = { At least one aces. }
+ B = { There are two or more aces. }

The possiblity of no aces is that (6^10 - 5^10). The possiblity of exactly one ace is 5^9. Hence:

    P{B|A} = P{AB} / P{A} = 1 - 10*5^9/(6^10 - 5^10)

## Problem 6.

The probability that a bolt is defective is that

    Pd = 0.25*0.05 + 0.35*0.04 + 0.4*0.02 = 0.0345

Hence:

    Pa = 0.0125/0.0345 = 125/345
    Pb = 0.0140/0.0345 = 140/345
    Pc = 0.0080/0.0345 = 80/345

# Problem 7.

The probability of a male colorblind is

    Pm = 5/100 = 1/20

The probability of a female colorblind is

    Pf = 25/10000 = 1/400

Since the numbers of male and female are the same in the population, then the required probability is

    P = Pm/(Pm + Pf) = 1/20 / (1/20 + 1/400) = 20/21
