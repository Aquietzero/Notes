# Sample Space

The results of experiments or observations will be called **events**.

We shall distinguish between **compound** (or decomposable) and **simple** (or indecomposable) events. For example, saying that a throw with two dice resulted in "sum six" amounts to saying that it resulted in "(1, 5) pr (2, 4) or (3, 3) or (4, 2) or (5, 1)" and this enumeration dcomposes the event "sum six" into five simple events.

**The simple events will be called sample points, or points for short. By definition, every indecomposable result of the (idealized) experiment is represented by one, and only one, sample point.** The aggregate of all sample points will be called the sample space. All events connected with a given (idealized) experiment can be described as aggregates of sample points.

The sample space provides a model of an ideal experiment in the sense that, by definition, __every thinkable outcome of the experiment is completely described by one, and only one, sample point.__ It is meaningful to talk about an event A only when it is clear for every outcome of the experiment whether the event A has or has not occurred. The collection of all those sample points representing outcomes where A has occurred completely describes the event. Conversely, any given aggregate A containing one or more sample points can be called an event; this event does, or does not, occur according as the outcome of the experiment is, or is not, represented by a point of the aggregate A. We therefore define the word **event to mean the same as an aggregate of sample points.** We shall say that an event A consists of (or contains) certain points, namely those representing outcomes of the ideal experiment in which A occurs.
